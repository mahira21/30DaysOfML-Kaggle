# 30DaysOfML-Kaggle
This repository contains my learning progress and notes from Kaggle's 30 Days of ML challenge.




- Implemented a Titanic survival prediction model using RandomForestClassifier  
- Loaded Titanic train and test datasets  
- Analyzed survival rates for men and women  
- Selected key features (Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch) for training  
- Preprocessed data using one-hot encoding for categorical variables  
- Trained a Random Forest model with 100 estimators and max depth of 5  
- Generated survival predictions and saved them as 'my_submission.csv'
