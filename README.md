# 30 Days of ML - Kaggle 

This repository contains my learning journey for Kaggle's **30 Days of ML** challenge. 

## Topics Covered

**Titanic Survival Prediction (Titanic survival prediction using RandomForestClassifier.ipynb)**  
   - Implemented survival prediction using Random Forest Classifier.  
   - Preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).  
   - Made predictions and saved results as "my_submission.csv".  
   
**Functions in Python (home_cost_calculation_solution.ipynb)**  
   - Covered function definitions, parameters, return values.   

**Data Types & Manipulation (Data_Types_Float_Integer_String_Boolean.ipynb)**  
   - Explained different Python data types (int, float, string, boolean).
     
**Conditions and Conditional Statements (Conditions_Conditional_Statements.ipynb)**
   - Worked with if, else, elif to evaluate conditions 
   - Covered comparison operators and boolean expressions  
   - Applied conditions in real world scenerios like grade calculation, project cost estimation, Food label determination and phone bill calculation.

**Python List Operations and Function (Python List Operations and Function Practices.ipynb)**
   - Worked with lists, list slicing, and functions
   - Used conditionals to manipulate and check lists  
   - Implemented a function to check if a guest is fashionably late
   - Predicted list lengths based on structure and indexing
   
**Melbourne Housing Prediction (Melbourne Housing Price Prediction.ipynb)**
   - Explored and preprocessed the Melbourne housing dataset for regression modeling..
   - Selected key numerical features and handled missing data effectively.
   - Trained and tested a Decision Tree Regressor to generate price predictions for residential properties.
